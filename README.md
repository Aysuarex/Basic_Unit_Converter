# Basic Unit Converter

## Introduction 
Have you ever been confused about "how many Fahrenheit's make one kelvin?", "Whats the relationship between Kilograms and pounds?🤔" or "How do I convert feet to metres?🤷🏾‍♂️".  Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore! Because here is a Unit converter made in C language to do all those conversions for you 😃 

## How It works :rocket:

* There are three categories of units to choose from, under which there are three different Units each. You are prompted to select a category and the category selected leads you to further prompts depending on the path chosen. The categories are: Temperature, Mass and Length.

* **Temperature**\
    -Kelvin\
    -Celsius\
    -Fahrenheit

* **Mass**\
    -Tonnes\
    -Kilograms\
    -Pounds

* **Length**\
    -Miles\
    -Feet\
    -Metres
